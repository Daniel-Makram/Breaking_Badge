# Breaking Badge 
Breaking Badge is an online platform to grant badges to users. 
Users can track their progression through their dashboards and visualise all of their aquired badges.  
Admins can track users progression through their dashboard, as well as grant badges, create new badges and visualise all of the already existing badges.  
Both parties can visualize some data through a stats view on their dashboards.

# What did we do ?
Following instructions, we had to base ourselves on some template code and create a functionning fullstack app to grant badges and have a admin view only dashboard and a user only view dashboard.  

We have to use a relational database with many-to-many relationships and design a simple permission system. 

On our website, the following features are available:
* Admin
  - List all badges
  - Create new badges 
  - Add new users
  - Visualize who got which badge
* User (still implementing features)
  - Can receive badges  
  
In the future, we'll work some more on this project and add some features that we did not have time to make (grant badges, mofify/delete badges, take away badges from users,...)
